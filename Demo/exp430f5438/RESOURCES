P3.5 : UCA0RXD


PORT5
-----

P5.6 : UCA1TXD
P5.7 : UCA1RXD


PORT7
-----

P1.0 -- XIN (32 kiHz crystal)
P1.1 -- XOUT (32 kiHz crystal, don't care: enabled via XIN)


T0A5
----

Tied to ACLK, continuous mode.  Clock enabled on power-up when crystal
stabilized, and runs continuously.

 CCR1
 CCR2-CCR4 : Unassigned
 IFG : Overflow counter for uptime clock


T0B7
----

Reserved for use within critical sections, by both infrastructure and
application.  Should be turned off when not in use.

 CCR0-CCR5 : Unassigned
 CCR6 : Capture CCI6B (ACLK) for FLL trimming

UCS
---

DCO referenced to XT1CLK
ACLK referenced to XT1CLK
SMCLK referenced to DCOCLKDIV, undivided
MCLK referenced to DCOCLKDIV

Due to errata UCS7 and UCS10, the FLL is normally disabled.
